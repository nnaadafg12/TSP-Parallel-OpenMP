# Parallelizing Travelling Salesman Problem - OpenMP

## Project Overview

This project focuses on solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using parallel approaches. The main objective is to evaluate how parallelization with OpenMP can improve the performance of a brute-force TSP solution by reducing execution time and better utilizing multi-core processors.

The project was developed as part of a parallel computing course, with emphasis on performance comparison, scalability, and practical application of shared-memory parallelism.


## Objectives

- Develop a parallel version using OpenMP.
- Compare execution time, speedup, and scalability between sequential and parallel implementations.
- Analyze the impact of thread count on performance.


## Acknowledgment

This project is based on and inspired by the following open-source repository, which was used as a baseline reference for the brute-force Traveling Salesman Problem implementation:

Abrar Jahin, Travelling Salesman Problem – Brute Force
GitHub Repository:
https://github.com/AbrarJahin/travelling-salesman-problem-brute-force

We acknowledge the original author for providing a clear and functional brute-force TSP implementation.
Our work extends and adapts this baseline by:

- Refactoring the code for modularity and clarity
- Introducing OpenMP parallelization
- Adding performance measurement and analysis
- Conducting comparative evaluation between sequential and parallel executions
